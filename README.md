Car Data Analysis 🚘📈
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of cars to extract meaningful insights.
We perform data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand how factors like year, price, mileage, horsepower, and model affect car value and performance.

📂 Dataset

Contains information such as:

Year – Manufacturing year of the car

Price – Selling price

Mileage – Kilometers driven

Horsepower – Engine power

Model – Car brand/model

Format: CSV file

🔧 Steps in Analysis

Data Cleaning

Handle missing values

Remove duplicates

Correct data types

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of car prices, mileage, horsepower

Trends over years

Relationships between features (e.g., Year vs Price, Horsepower vs Price)

Visualization

Scatter plots (Year vs Price, Mileage vs Price)

Histograms & KDE plots (distribution of features)

Box plots (outlier detection)

Heatmaps (correlation between variables)

Statistical Measures

Mean, Median, Mode

Skewness & Kurtosis

Correlation coefficients

📊 Key Insights

Car price decreases as the year of manufacture gets older.

Higher horsepower cars tend to have higher prices.

Mileage has a negative correlation with price (more driven = cheaper).

Certain brands/models retain value better than others.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python (NumPy, Pandas) → Data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualization

Scikit-learn (optional) → Predictive modeling (price prediction)

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Jupyter Notebook / Python script for analysis.

📌 Future Scope

Build a Machine Learning model to predict car prices.

Add interactive dashboards using Plotly or Streamlit.

Expand dataset with fuel type, transmission, and owner details.
